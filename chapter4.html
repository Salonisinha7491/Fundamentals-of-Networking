    <p>An IP address, or <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> address, is a series of numbers that identifies any device
        on a network. Computers use IP addresses to communicate with each other both over the internet as well as on
        other networks.An IP address identifies a network or device on the internet. <br>

        It is generally expressed in a set of numbers <strong>for example 192.155.12.1 </strong>. Here each number in
        the set is from <em> 0 to 255 range</em>. Or we can say that a full IP address ranges from 0.0.0.0 to
        255.255.255.255. And these IP addresses are assigned by <strong> <a  id="iana" href="./glossary.html#giana">IANA </a></strong>(known as Internet Corporation For
        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).


    <h4><u>Parts of IP Address </u></h4>
    An IP address has two parts: <strong><a  id="ni" href="./glossary.html#gni">the network ID</a> </strong>, comprising the first three numbers of the address,
    and <strong> <a  id="hi" href="./glossary.html#ghi">a host ID</a></strong>, the fourth number in the address. So on your home network — 192.168.1.1, for example
    – 192.168.1 is the network ID, and the final number is the host ID.

    <h3 align="center"><u>IPv4</u></h3>
    <p>IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4. It consists of 4 numbers separated by the dots. Each number can be from 0-255
        in decimal numbers. But computers do not understand decimal numbers, they instead change them to binary numbers
        which are only 0 and 1. Therefore, in binary, this (0-255) range can be written as (00000000 – 11111111). Since
        each number N can be represented by a group of 8-digit binary digits. So, a whole IPv4 binary address can be
        represented by 32-bits of binary digits. In IPv4, a unique sequence of bits is assigned to a computer, so a
        total of (2^32) devices approximately = 4,294,967,296 can be assigned with IPv4. </p>

    <h3><u> Notation of IP Address </u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dotted Decimal</li>
        <li>Binary Notation</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Dotted Decimal</h4>
    <p> IPv4 addresses are most often written in dotted decimal notation. In this format, each 8-bit byte in the 32-bit
        IPv4 address is converted from binary or hexadecimal to a decimal number between 0 (0000 0000 or 0x00) and 255
        (1111 1111 or 0xFF). The numbers are then written as four decimal numbers with dots between them: W.X.Y.Z. <br>

        For example, 1010 1100 0001 0000 1100 1000 0000 0010 (0xAC 10 C8 02) becomes 172.16.200.2. And 1011 1111 1111
        1111 0000 1110 0010 1100 (0xBF FF 0E 2C) becomes 191.255.14.44, and so on. <br>

        To make the IPv4 address more compact and easier to read, an IPv4 address is
        usually written in decimal form with a decimal point (dot) separating the bytes. This
        format is referred to as dotted-decimal notation. Figure 1 shows an IPv4 address in
        dotteddecimal notation. Note that because each byte (octet) is only 8 bits, each
        number in the dotted-decimal notation is between 0 and 255.

    </p>

    <h4>Binary Notation</h4>
    <p>In binary notation, an IPv4 address is displayed as 32 bits. To make the address more
        readable, one or more spaces is usually inserted between each octet (8 bits). Each
        octet is often referred to as a byte. So it is common to hear an IPv4 address referred
        to as a 32-bit address, a 4-octet address, or a 4-byte address. The following is an
        example of an IPv4 address in binary notation: <br>
        For example, the IPv4 address 11000000101010000000101000011001 is represented as 192.168.10.25 in dotted decimal
        notation.</p>
    <h3 align="center">IPv6</h3>
    <hr width="500px">
    <p>The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the address size of IP addresses. The IPv4 is a 32-bit address,
        whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address. IPv6 provides a large address space, and it contains a simple
        header as compared to IPv4.

        IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address made up of 8 sets of 16 bits each, and these 8 sets are separated by a
        colon. In IPv6, each hexadecimal character represents 4 bits. So, we need to convert 4 bits to a hexadecimal
        number at a time. <br>
